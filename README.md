# PlayerEx Relics

#### Description

This mod adds Curios compatibility with PlayerEx, along a RPG theme. 

#### Health Potions

There are three health potions added: small, medium and large. Health Potions have a chance to drop from mobs, and when picked up by the player will heal for two, four and six hearts, respectively.

#### Relics

There are four relics added: amulet, body, head and ring. Relics have a chance to drop from mobs. Relics have randomly generated attributes assigned to them, that are applied when equipped as curios. The randomly generated attributes are taken from PlayerEx attributes, and have randomly generated values as well.

Relics come with a rarity system: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Mythical, Legendary and Immortal. Relics can have up to five attribute bonuses attached to them. Factors that influence a relic's rarity: the number of attributes attached to the relic, the bonus value attached to each attribute, and the attributes attached themselves also have a weight. All attributes that are not DATA types can be attached to a relic, including addon attributes from mods that depend on the PlayerEx API.


All randomness and chance to drop is weighted and fully configurable.
