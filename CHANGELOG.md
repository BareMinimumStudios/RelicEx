## Notes 🍎
- 💖 ***This is deemed to be a "legacy" version due to adapting to the original mod by the book. Previous issues with this mod may be present, but a rewrite is underway.***

- This update is meant to work with the recent **PlayerEX** (`+4.x.x+1.20.1`)
- Certain attributes may not have the proper formatting at the moment.
- This will be a present solution until a proper rewrite is completed.

## Changes 🌽
- Weights have been moved directly to his mod instead of having any relationship to `properties`. More documentation on this later.
- Removed projectile damage attribute in favor of the ranged weapon API.
- Updated all dependencies.
